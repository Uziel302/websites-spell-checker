For large amounts of texts, with less false positives

Spell checkers has been around since the 1960s and they are still part of the largest editors: Microsoft Office, Google Drive, Google Chrome, Gmail and many others.

I hate typos, but I also don't like the common spell checkers:
-They mark any unknown word as a typo. 
-They distract the writer in the middle of his writing flow. 
-They are limited to check one file at a time.
-They don't work well with big files.
-They don't work well with online texts. You need to copy paste to editor or text field.
-They mark the same unknown word multiple times.

By creating a simple list of high probability typos, I can find typos more efficiently, even in huge data bases like English Wikipedia.
